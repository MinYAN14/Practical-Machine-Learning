### Course Project Description
With the availability of low cost accelerometers, there are many opportunities to measure human activities. One application of this is measuring the proper form of weight lifting. What people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. 

In this project, the goal is to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants and examine whether we can predict the manner in which they did the exercise.  

Participants were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available from the website here: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset).
